# ImageMatching
Remote sensing image matching framework developed with c++. Algorithms included are as follows:
- Phase congruency
- Wavelet image pyramid constructing
- RIFT feature matching (refrence paperï¼šhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8935498)
- Nonlinear scale space
- Mutual information (MI)
- FFTShift, IFFTShift
